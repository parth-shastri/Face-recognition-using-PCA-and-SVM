# Face-recognition-using-PCA-and-SVM

This contains a basic task of face recognition from a predifined labels more like a classification problem solved using traditional machine learning methods like Principal Components analysis and Support vector machines for classification.

We can try this problem using some other dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or LDA.

The dataset used is, labeled faces in the wild dataset (comes with sklearn library).

Was trying to gain some perspective on traditional machine learning deviating from my usual deep learning projects.
